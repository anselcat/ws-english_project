          <p>The code of Hammurabi is enacted in Babylon contains the first recorded laws surrounding capital punishment. The code issued justice based on the three classes of Babylonian society (property owners, freed men, and slaves). While the code aimed to achieve equality, it instead imposed less severe punishments to those from higher classes</p>

        <h2 class="title">The Roman Emipre</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The Romans punished a wide variety of crimes with execution. Executions were often public, seen as quality entertainment. Criminals were beheaded, fed to wild beasts, or tied to the tails of horses and dragged to death, all for the entertainment of crowds. These deaths were part of lavish games that lasted several days in arenas such as the Colosseum.</p>
          <p>Some crimes corresponded with particular punishments. Patricide (killing your parents or grandparents), for example, was regarded as one of the worst crimes a Roman could commit. The punishment was to be sewn into a sack with a snake, a monkey, a rabid dog, and a cockerel, then thrown into a river. However, the most painful and degrading form of execution in ancient Rome was crucifixion. This was reserved only for non-citizens who had committed the most egregious of crimes and prisoners would be stripped naked and nailed to a wooden cross. It took days to die, during which the victim would be in excruciating pain bleeding from the inside out.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Criminals in the middle ages were executed based on class. The wealthiest and most high standing in society faced what, at the time, was seen as the noblest form of death- beheading. Others, of lower classes or convicted of particularly atrocious crimes, were subject to brutal methods like hanging, the Catherine wheel, or quartering.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Cesar Beccaria publishes his essay "On Crime and Punishment." It became hugely influential in Europe and the United States. Beccaria used "On Crime and Punishment" to examine executions and other cruel punishments on a philosophical level. His conclusions challenged both the notion that governments had the right to condemn someone to death and the idea that executing them would deter others from committing the same crime.</p>

        <h2 class="title">The Invaention of the Guillotine</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Physician Joseph-Ignace Guillotin was among those responsible for the creation of the Guillotine a device whose blade could decapitate a victim in a single pass. This was seen as more humane than other forms of execution in use at the time, ending its victims cleanly and quickly and could be constructed very easily meaning the machine was used on people of all social classes not simply the rich and powerful. During the reign of terror, the daily parade of convicts was a source of entertainment for the people of Paris particularly if the convicts were nobility.</p>

        <h2 class="title">The UN publishes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The third article of the declaration states that everyone has the right to life liberty and security of person. The U.N. later passed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which encourages all member states to abolish the death penalty. Following the publication of these documents, 134 countries have abolished the death penalty, notable exceptions being China, Japan, India, Egypt, North Korea, and the U.S.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Furman v. Georgia</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme courts rules 5-4 in Furman vs. Georgia, temporarily banning the death penalty until state laws could be rewritten to remove arbitrary and discriminatory language. The case examined a multitude of factors including racial bias against black defendants. However, each of the justices released a separate opinion, and only two raised opposition to the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment. The remaining justices that ruled in favor of the temporary ban simply viewed that the way the death penalty was currently implemented was cruel and unusual. </p>

        <h2 class="title">The Issue Today</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>From the Roman Empire to the French Revolution, public executions were the height of entertainment. People flocked to the guillotines each day to see the death of those who wished the republic harm. A lot had to change for the death penalty to become the controversial social justice issue that it is today. Around the time Beccaria published "On Crimes and Punishment" the concept of prisons was just starting to make its way across Europe. The arguments Beccaria presented coupled with the fact that prisons created a way to remove convicts off the streets without killing them led to a drop in executions. Prisons negated the need for public executions, so citizens no longer viewed capital punishment as a source entertainment.</p>
          <p>Then, in the late 1940s following the atrocities of the Holocaust and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights many countries began reexamining their stances on the death penalty. Today most of the world views capital punishment as cruel and unessacary. Many countries have banned the death penalty including France. Had Charles Darnay been tried today, execution by guillotine wouldn't even be an option. Instead, the worst sentenced he could receive is life in prison.</p>
